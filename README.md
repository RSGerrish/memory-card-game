To practice using states and hooks in functional components

## Final Thoughts

I like the final product, unfortunately this one had to come with a fair bit of help. I am struggling to get my mind around how the lifecycle works in React in general. I had to start over 3 times due to 'too many renders' errors which I know is because I am updating state incorrectly, however I was never quite sure exactly how. I understand how this project works, however I had to refer to an example to really workout this project.

Main takeaway from this one - Make sure I understand the data I am working with first. I spent a good bit of time spinning my wheels on this one because I was tied up with trying to write code to manipulate data that I didn't even know the structure of yet. I also was tied up on making everything a state and was forgetting about props... Anyway, this was good practice
